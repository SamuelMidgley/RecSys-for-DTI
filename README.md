# Matrix Factorisation for Drug-Target Interactions
Code is from a group project for a task set by AstraZeneca at University of Sheffield

Includes two models:
- Base Matrix Factorisation which is the standard matrix factorisation model using stochastic gradient descent
- Matrix Factorisation with similarity matrices, which uses the chemical similarites of the drugs and targets to better approximate a drug-target interaction

Project Supervisors: Haiping Lu and Peizhen Bai
