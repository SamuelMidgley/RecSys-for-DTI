# Matrix Factorisation for Drug-Target Interactions

NOTE: Upload of Similarity Matrix Code pending

Code is part of a group project for a task set by AstraZeneca

Includes two models:
- Base Matrix Factorisation which is the standard matrix factorisation model using stochastic gradient descent
- Matrix Factorisation with similarity matrices, which uses the chemical similarites of the drugs and targets to better approximate a drug-target interaction

Institution: University of Sheffield

Project Supervisors: Haiping Lu and Peizhen Bai
